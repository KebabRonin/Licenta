- Why aren't the current simulations good enough? They generated 10 years after all
> 10 years in 1 real time month, seems fair enough.. But 100s of years must be simulated to be useful in experimenting with anti-climate change actions

> Producing multiple 100 year simulations is currently out of reach, but by utilizing GPU architecture we may be able to overcome this. \[...] Also, the clouds in a 2D model are not as realistic as those in a 3D model.[Source](https://hannahlab.org/blog/what-is-super-parameterization/)

**As model resolution increases, errors associated with moist convective processes are increased** as assumptions which are statistically valid for larger grid boxes become questionable once the grid boxes shrink in scale towards the size of the convection itself. At resolutions greater than T639, which has a grid box dimension of about 30 kilometres (19 mi), the Arakawa-Schubert convective scheme produces minimal convective precipitation, making most precipitation unrealistically stratiform in nature.

Too few inputs?

Unclean data? (somewhere from kaggle, can't find it now)
