- Why aren't the current simulations good enough? They generated 10 years after all
> 10 years in 1 real time month, seems fair enough..
> But it is a question of resolution. With advancements in current tech (with ML), finer resolution models could be achieved (Source: me)
> Producing multiple 100 year simulations is currently out of reach, but by utilizing GPU architecture we may be able to overcome this. \[...] Also, the clouds in a 2D model are not as realistic as those in a 3D model.[Source](https://hannahlab.org/blog/what-is-super-parameterization/)

> Current sim physics are not good enough:
>> Thus, in most GCMs, in addition to parameterized cloud micro- physics, convection and its influence on atmospheric circulation are represented by convective parameterization schemes, which are usually based on **simplified theories, limited obser- vations, and empirical relationships**

Too few inputs?

Unclean data? (somewhere from kaggle, can't find it now)
